This is where I plan to keep all my non confidential config files.

Things like perl templates, Vim and bashrc etc etc.

I've added a script at bin/Deploy.sh which when run from there will create all the right directories 
 and roll it out.  Check it out and be sure you want it to do this as it will overwrite files, including
 the bash configs!
I've added a backup option that puts the overwritten versions into ~/deployment_backups
